	<h3>Under maintenance due to concerns on the biases of the model</h3>
    <p class="lg:col-span-3">
		This space contained a way to quickly execute the open source <a href="https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion" target="_blank">Latent Diffusion</a> model by CompVis, trained on the <a href="https://laion.ai/laion-400-open-dataset/" target="_blank">LAION-400M</a> dataset.<br>
        We believe in being transparent and bringing and open and honest discussions about model biases and its issues. But after some users reported seeing some really disturbing images with certain prompts from this model, we decided to take down the space for now..
