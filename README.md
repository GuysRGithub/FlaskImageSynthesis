	<h2>Under maintenance due to concerns on the biases of the model</h2>
    <p class="lg:col-span-3">
		This space contained a way to quickly execute the open source text-to-image <a href="https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion" target="_blank">Latent Diffusion</a> model by CompVis, trained on the <a href="https://laion.ai/laion-400-open-dataset/" target="_blank">LAION-400M</a> dataset.<br><br>
        We believe transparency and bringing and open and honest discussions about model biases is the best way to deal with such challegnges. However after some users reported seeing some gruesome NSFW images with certain prompts from this model, we decided to take down this Spaces for now.
